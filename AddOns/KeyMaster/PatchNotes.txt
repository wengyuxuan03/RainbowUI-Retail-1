--------------------------------------------------
Updates:
- When you are a party member of the matchmaking group system: Looking for Raid (LFR),

  (user created) groups or normal party members outside of your instance group.

--------------------------------------------------
Key Master v1.0.0
--------------------------------------------------

  v0.0.94 could cause errors in clients with newer versions. It will now ignore those
  users until they update to 0.0.94b or higher.
- Verified Dragonflight Season 4 compatibility
- Several UI enhancements.
- There are some changes to the rating system for Dragonflight Season 4. We have added
  preliminary calculation changes that will account for some changes but not all. Due to the somewhat
  complex and obscure nature of the rating system, there is a notice at the top of the
  addon that will display until we are confident that all DF S4 rating calculations are correctly
  displayed. Please visit our Discord https://discord.gg/bbMaUpfgn8 or GitHub 
  https://github.com/Puresyn/KeyMaster to report or check the status on any new or ongoing corrections.
- Adjusted party frame data columns to leave more room for player name and class information.

- Added QOL querying of keystone and overall rating information for party members without
  Key Master installed from the commonly used Open Raid library (if they have another
  addon with openRaid installed: i.e. Details, etc.). This is not always dependable or
  guaranteed to be accurate, but it's the best alternative for non-addon party member 
  information; at least, for the time being.
- Replaced "Key Master Not Detected!" text with an icon on the party frame for
  party members without Key Master installed.
- Fixed Key Master icon showing up as a "?" in the in-game AddOn List. Now shows correct icon.

  between same server and cross-server parties.
